# FlowNet Expert â€“ Deep Learning for Optical Flow Workshop

Building a FlowNet algorithm with PyTorch! The idea is simple, given two images, output the optical flow!


In this project, we're going to:

1.   **Load and Prepare the Dataset** for the Model
2.   Define a **FlowNet Architecture**
3.   **Train the Model** on KITTI
4.   **Run the Model**
